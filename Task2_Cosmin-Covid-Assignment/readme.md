# This is Cosmin's folder of Coding 1 - Assignment 2
It contains the main folders required for the data analysis project on Covid-19 data as of 04.11.2020.
# Codes
The codes folder contains R scripts and 2 rmarkdown scripts for creating both a pdf and an html output of the analysis project. The R scripts each pertain to a single task, such as cleaning, merging, analyzing etc. The rmarkdown files contain the full analysis, but do not contain the data gathering and cleaning parts. They work directly with processed and cleaned data for the sake of ease of readability.

# Data
The data folder structure contains both raw unprocessed data and cleaned data, both of which are outputs from the respective R scripts found in the codes folder. The data folder also contains variables.xls files which clarify the data types the project worked with.
