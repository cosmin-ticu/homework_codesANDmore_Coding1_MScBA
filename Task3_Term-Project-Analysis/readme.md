# Cosmin's Term Project for Coding 1 & Data Analysis 2
This folder structure contains the codes, outputs and data used in the writing and analysis of the survey project conducted for my term project. The codes folder contains individual R scripts for the cleaning and analysis parts with detailed descriptions within the code about inferences, argumentation and findings. It also contains 2 rmarkdown files, one of which outputs an html, the other outputs a pdf. They are entirely the same. The outputs folder contains the html document outputs of various model comparisons. It is highly advised to always link back to those documents when going through the code. The data folder contains the raw and clean structures of data, as well as variable explanation files to understand the original survey data (which is also copied in there). Lastly, the docs folder contains the html and pdf neat outputs resulting from the rmarkdown files.
