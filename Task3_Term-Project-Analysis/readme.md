# Cosmin's Term Project for Coding 1 & Data Analysis 2

[Public GitHub repo link](https://github.com/cosmin-ticu/homework_codesANDmore_Coding1_MScBA/tree/master/Task3_Term-Project-Analysis)

This folder structure contains the codes, outputs and data used in the writing and analysis of the survey project conducted for my term project. The codes folder contains individual R scripts for the cleaning and analysis parts with detailed descriptions within the code about inferences, argumentation and findings. There is also a piece of code written by Agoston Reguly (@regulyagoston) which acts as a summary statistic function. It also contains 2 rmarkdown files, one of which outputs an html, the other outputs a pdf. They are entirely the same. 

The outputs folder contains the html document outputs of various model comparisons. It is highly advised to always link back to those documents when going through the code. The data folder contains the raw and clean structures of data, as well as variable explanation files to understand the original survey data (which is also copied in there). Lastly, the docs folder contains the html and pdf neat outputs resulting from the rmarkdown files.

The data was gathered from an anonymous source, a Fortune 100 company and it represents a company-wide survey about employee safety in the workplace. All of the provided variables take a qualitative nominal or ordinal form. As such, this data in its current format is only suitable for probabilistic regression or for classification tasks.
